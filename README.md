# ip-changer-python
A PY script to change your plubic ip with TOR every 10 or more seconds depends what you want.

USAGE: $sudo ip_changer.py

pip install == https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ 

@Quotes install pip and execute "pip install PySocks"

why need sudo ? because.. the torctl needs to be started with sudo..
